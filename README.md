A multiuser sketchpad based off of MR Doob's chrome experiment:
http://mrdoob.com/projects/multiuserpad/

mrdoob.com does not publish the backend to his script so i've been attempting to reverse engineer it for my own uses.

Requires Node.js, socket.io (http://socket.io/)

This is a work-in-progress, but at least the sketching part works! the nickname thing doesn't really work properly.

Now with more jQuery!
